# The mstress runs stress tests on QFS metaserver and HDFS namenode. To be able
# to work with the namenode, the java HDFS client needs to be compiled and run
# with hadoop hdfs jars.
#
# To make this process uniform across mstress master and slaves, we copy the
# jars to a local directory and copy it around to all participating hosts at
# a fixed location.
# (Without this, each client would need to add entries to /etc/yum.repos.d/,
#  and require root access to install hadoop client rpms).
#
# This script packages the jars locally on the build node, so that the
# 'mstress_prepare_clients.sh' script can copy it over to master and clients.
#
# Run this program with the path of hadoop client jars as argument (default
# /usr/lib/hadoop/client/), and it will create a "mstress_hdfs_client_jars"
# directory containing the jars.
