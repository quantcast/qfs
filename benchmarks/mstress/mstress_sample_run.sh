# This is a single-button command of the benchmarking process. You just give
# it the metaserver (perhaps run by example/sampleservers/sample_setup.py) and
# the namenode (see README for how to install and run namenode), and this will 
# package the jars, compile the sources, setup the clients on localhost, and
# run the tests.
