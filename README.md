- Release 2.2.4 is a bug fix release. [Release notes](https://github.com/quantcast/qfs/wiki/Release-Notes).

Release 2.2.3

QFS version 2.2.2

Release 2.2.2 is a bug fix release. [Release notes](https://github.com/quantcast/qfs/wiki/Release-Notes).

QFS version 2.2.1

Release 2.2.1 is a bug fix release. [Release notes](https://github.com/quantcast/qfs/wiki/Release-Notes).

QFS version 2.2.0

Release 2.2.0 contains symbolic links support, and minor bug fixes.

QFS version 2.1.3

Release 2.1.3 contains DNS resolver's number of open socket accounting bug fix.
This bug might manifest itself in at least one non obvious way: chunk server
might continuously fail to create or open chunk files if/when the open sockets
counter becomes negative.

Release 2.1.2 contains minor bug fixes, meta and chunk servers watchdog.

Release 2.1.1 contains minor bug fixes.

Non blocking DNS resolver is the new feature in release 2.1.0. The new
DNS resolver is intended to improve S3 [compatible] object store IO
concurrency and reduce latency.

Meta server replication is the major new feature in release 2.0.0. Meta server
replication provides automatic meta server fail over. With meta server replication
configured QFS does not have single point of failure.

# Quantcast File System

Quantcast File System (QFS) is a high-performance, fault-tolerant, distributed
file system developed to support MapReduce processing, or other applications
reading and writing large files sequentially.

QFS used in Quantcast production cluster.

QFS servers have been tested on 64-bit CentOS 6 extensively and run on Linux
variants. The QFS client tools work on OS X and Cygwin as well.

project [wiki](https://github.com/quantcast/qfs/wiki/Introduction-To-QFS).

## Getting QFS

QFS is available through various channels.

- **[BigTop][bigtop]**: QFS packages for rpm and debian
  based systems are available through the [BigTop project][packages].
- **[Binary Distributions][bd]**: There are various binary distributions
  packaged as tarballs available on the [Binary Distributions Page][bd].
- **Compile from source**: QFS can be compiled on Linux variants, Mac OS X, and
  Cygwin. See the [wiki][develop] for more information on how to build QFS
  yourself.

## Trying QFS

Once you have aquired QFS through one of the methods above, you can take QFS for
a quick test drive. Setting up a single node configuration to familiarize
yourself with QFS is very easy.

1.  Extract the distribution tarball.

        $ tar -xzf qfs.tgz && cd qfs

1.  Set up a single node QFS instance. This will create a workspace in
    `~/qfsbase`, start two chunk servers and one metaserver.

            $ ./examples/sampleservers/sample_setup.py -a install
            Binaries presence checking - OK.
            Setup directories - OK.
            Setup config files - OK.
            Started servers - OK.

1.  Add tools binary path to`PATH`

        $ PATH=${PWD}/bin/tools:${PATH}

1.  Make a temporary directory on the file system

        $ qfsshell -s localhost -p 20000 -q -- mkdir /qfs/tmp

1.  Create a file containing "Hello World", Reed-Solomon encoded, with
    replication 1.

            $ echo 'Hello World' | cptoqfs -s localhost -p 20000 -S -k /qfs/tmp/helloworld -d -

1.  Cat the file content.

        $ qfscat -s localhost -p 20000 /qfs/tmp/helloworld

1.  Stat the file to see encoding (RS or not), replication level, and mtime.

        $ qfsshell -s localhost -p 20000 -q -- stat /qfs/tmp/helloworld

1.  Copy the file locally to the current directory.

        $ cpfromqfs -s localhost -p 20000 -k /qfs/tmp/helloworld -d ./helloworld

1.  Remove the file from QFS.

        $ qfsshell -s localhost -p 20000 -q -- rm /qfs/tmp/helloworld

1.  Stop the servers.

        $ ./examples/sampleservers/sample_setup.py -a stop

1.  Uninstall the single node instance.

        $ ./examples/sampleservers/sample_setup.py -a uninstall

## Benchmarking QFS

A performance comparison between QFS and HDFS 1.0.2 shows QFS is faster both at
reading and writing 20 TB of uncompressed data on our test system, a
heterogeneous cluster with 6,500 disk drives. See more information regarding
this in our [wiki][perf].
