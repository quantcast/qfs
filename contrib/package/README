One can build the RPMs and the Debian packages using the contents in this
directory. While these are suitable for single-node or small deployments of
QFS, larger and complex installations of QFS are likely to require custom
scripts for installation, configuration, and running of the QFS servers. For
this reason, the packaging scripts are moved under contrib directory.
