This directory contains the RPM specfile and any patches required to build QFS
against a Red Hat-like distribution such as RHEL or Fedora.  It is recommended
to use a tool such as mock (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock) to
build, as doing so will ensure cleaner builds and greater flexibility.

To build using mock
===================

  Prerequisites:

  1. Install mock:

    # yum install -y mock

  2. Find a configuration in /etc/mock/ that suits the distribution you are
     currently building against.  Currently, QFS has been tested to build
     against the following distributions:

    - Fedora 17
    - CentOS/Scientific Linux 6

  3. If building against EL6, add the following Yum repository to your Mock
     configuration under the config_opts['yum.conf'] section:

    [epel-apache-maven]
    name=maven from apache foundation.
    baseurl=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-6/x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

  Building the RPMs:

  1. Make an SRPM from the current git HEAD:

    # make srpm

  2. Using the mock configuration you found, build RPMs from the SRPM:

    # mock -r <name of configuration, without the .cfg> rpmbuild/SRPMS/*.src.rpm

  3. Built RPMs will land in /var/lib/mock/<configuration>/result.


To build using rpmbuild/make
============================

  Prerequisites:

  On Fedora
  ---------

  1. Install the following RPMs:

    # yum -y install boost-devel cmake fuse-devel gcc-c++ libuuid-devel \
      make openssl-devel python-devel xfsprogs-devel java-devel \
      jpackage-devel maven

  On EL6
  ------

  1. Add the following Yum repo to /etc/yum.repos.d:

    [epel-apache-maven]
    name=maven from apache foundation.
    baseurl=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-6/x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

  2. Install the following RPMs:

    # yum -y install boost-devel cmake fuse-devel gcc-c++ libuuid-devel make \
      openssl-devel python-devel xfsprogs-devel java-devel jpackage-devel \
      apache-maven

  Building the RPMs:

  3. Make RPMs from the current git HEAD:

    # make rpm

  4. Built RPMs will land in rpmbuild/RPMS/.
