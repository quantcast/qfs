The specs directory contains the .spec files needed to build the RPMs for the
different QFS components.

Prerequisites: 
1. Ensure that the $JAVA_HOME variable is set correctly, and the java headers
   are at $JAVA_HOME/include.
2. If the java include path is different, then modify the spec file by adding
   the following flags to the cmake command:
   -D JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH=/java/path/include -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .

To build the metaserver RPM:
rpmbuild -v -ba specs/qfs-metaserver.spec

To build the chunkserver RPM:
rpmbuild -v -ba specs/qfs-chunkserver.spec

To build the client RPM:
rpmbuild -v -ba specs/qfs-clients.spec
