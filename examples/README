This directory contains the following contents:

1. cc/kfssample_main.cc
   cc/CMakeLists.txt
  The C++ client to access QFS. The binary gets compiled as part of QFS build
  (please refer to QFS Wiki Developer-Documentation), and the sample gets
  copied to the <build>/bin/examples directory where <build> is the selected
  build directory.

2. java/KfsSample.java
  The Java client to access QFS.
  To compile:
   $ cd examples/java/
   $ javac -classpath ../../build/qfs-*.jar KfsSample.java
  To run, assuming that make install was performed in ../../build/release,
  or top level make was invoked with no or default target:
   $ libdir="`cd ../../build/release/lib && pwd`"
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${libdir}"
   $ qfsjar=`echo ../../build/qfs-*.jar`
   $ java -Djava.library.path="$libdir" -classpath ".:$qfsjar" KfsSample 127.0.0.1 20000
  (Note: on OS X, use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

3. python/kfssample.py
   python/kfssample.cfg
  Python support is at experimental stage now. Nevertheless, one can run this
  example to access QFS via python. The QFS Wiki Developer-Documentation
  explains how to build and install the python QFS extension module.
  To run the kfssample.py, please set your PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  accordingly and point it to a QFS metaserver via the kfssample.cfg.

4. sampleservers
  Directory with a python script to bring up a simple QFS server locally.

  Once you build the C++ binaries (refer to QFS Wiki Developer-Documentation)
  point the sampleservers/sample_setup.py script to a config file and the
  build paths to start the servers.

  A sample config file (sampleservers/sample_setup.cfg file) is provided that
  starts up a metaserver, two chunk servers, and a webserver to monitor the
  servers. Please refer to the comments/Usage of sampleservers/sample_setup.py.
