# This file defines parameters for the KFS test program flogger.py.
# It is read using the ConfigParser module.  The values defined here
# are actually the same as the defaults contained in the program, so
# this is just for illustration.  
#
# A sample KfsClient.prp file is provided in conf directory.  That file
# defines the location of the metaserver.  To run this program, a
# suitable KfsClient.prp should be created where this program is executed.
#
#
# XXX The log file should probably be a command-line argument.
