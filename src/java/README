Background
==========

QFS uses Java for the following needs:

1. To let Java applications use QFS. This is enabled by the QFS Access library.
   Java applications can use the APIs in qfs-access-<ver>.jar.

2. To let Apache Hadoop use QFS as a backing store. This is enabled by the
   Hadoop QFS plugin. Apache Hadoop users can simply drop in the
   hadoop-<ver>-qfs-<ver>.jar to their Hadoop setup to use QFS.

   The following Apache Hadoop versions are supported:
   * Apache Hadoop branch1 (hadoop-1.0.X, hadoop-1.1.X)
   * Apache Hadoop trunk   (hadoop-0.23.X, hadoop-2.X.X)


Compiling
=========

To compile the Hadoop QFS plugin for Apache Hadoop 'branch1', one requires the
hadoop-core-<ver>.jar. To do the same for Apache Hadoop 'trunk', one requires
hadoop-common-<ver>.jar. The javabuild.sh script is provided to handle these
dependencies.

The script uses Apache Maven to obtain the dependent JARs and compile the
qfs-access and hadoop-qfs sub modules. In most cases, doing one of the
following is sufficient:

  * Run './javabuild.sh' to build only the qfs-access.
  * Run './javabuild.sh <hadoop-version>' (eg: './javabuild.sh 2.0.2-alpha') to
    build qfs-access as well as hadoop-qfs JARs.

The build classes and JARs are created under <srcdir>/build/java.
